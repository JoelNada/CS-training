Accessing customer needs:

Try to analyze what the customer is looking for

3 Types:
	Functional: Needs of your selfs 
Social: Wants for luxury 
Emotional: Buying loved one’s used things

Functional needs: Needs that focus on achieving a specific task or function. Customers require solutions that allow them to perform these activities.
Social needs: Needs that fixate on the perception of a product or service. While these needs aren’t at the forefront of a customer’s mind, they can impact their final decision.
Emotional needs: These needs concentrate on feeling a certain way when using a product or service.

Look:
Emphasizing the email
Tone
Urgency
Usage of negative and positive words
Sarcastic 

Ask:
Get as much information from the customer
What to ask and when to ask

Try: 
Try to be on the customers shoes 
You need to understand what is the expectation
Treat customers according to their expectations



Building Relationships with customers:

Customer relations are the efforts a company makes to connect with customers and build positive long-term relationships with them. The goal of customer relations is to connect with your customers on a deeper, more meaningful level. Good customer relations can help a business retain current customers, as well as gain new ones.

Customer relations is important for a business for many reasons. People who feel connected to a brand on a deeper level are more likely to continue to support the brand and recommend the brand to their friends and family. So, having strong customer relationships is important because it creates brand loyalty. When a customer feels loyal to your brand, they’re going to keep purchasing from your brand and may even try new products.

Benefits of maintaining good customer relationships:

Cultivate 
Repeat 
Boost customer loyalty 
Monitory 
Feedback 
Transparent
Personalized goodies 
Resolving the issues before the deadline 
Understand customer needs
Provide great customer service
Consistent service 

Cultivate repeat customers: When your customers have consistent positive experiences with your business, they’re more likely to choose you over competitors. Building strong customer relationships is an easy way to cultivate repeat customers and build loyalty.

Improve customer satisfaction: Keeping your customers happy is crucial for any business. Customer satisfaction increases the chances that a customer will continue to support you and write positive reviews about your business.

Boost customer loyalty: Oftentimes, customers will choose one brand over another because they feel loyal to them. Customer loyalty is a great way to increase sales and drive profit.

Gain a better understanding of your customers: When you have a better understanding of your customers, you can better cater your products to them. Building good relationships with your customers is a good way to get feedback on how you can improve. If a customer feels like they can trust you, they’re going to feel comfortable sharing their honest opinions with you.

Increase sales: When you have good relationships with your customers, not only are they going to continue to support your business, they’re going to tell the people they know to support you, too. They also are more likely to write positive reviews for your business. All of this can lead to increased sales and higher revenue.


8 Methods of building a good customer relationship:

1. Be consistent
2. Use CRM software
3. Foster an emotional connection
4. Provide excellent customer service
5. Be transparent and communicative
6. Create personalized experiences
7. Understand customer needs
8. Solicit customer feedback


1. Be consistent
Consistency is key. You don’t want your customers having an extremely positive interaction one day and then a very average one the next. You need to keep all of your interactions with your customers at the same positive level. Your customers should know that every time they step into your store or interact with one of your employees, they’re going to have a good experience.

2. Use CRM software
CRM software is customer relationship management technology that a business can use to manage relationships and interactions with current and new customers. CRM software can be very helpful for building strong customer relationships because it’s a way to get to know your audience so you can figure out the right ways to market to them. With CRM software, all of your employees will have access to real-time client data that they can analyze to better understand their target cust

3. Foster an emotional connection
One of the best ways to build customer relationships is by fostering an emotional connection with your customers. Customers who are fully emotionally connected to a brand are on average 70% more valuable than customers who aren’t emotionally connected to the brand.
There are many ways you can go about creating an emotional connection with your customers. Be vulnerable with them and relate to their struggles. Communicate with them in a real and personal way. Show interest in your customers’ lives and spend the time to get to know them. All of this will help you form an emotional connection with your customer that can hugely benefit your business.

4. Provide excellent customer service
Providing good customer service is an essential part of building customer relationships. You want your customers to feel comfortable going to you if they need help with anything. If the product they bought from your business is defective, offer a refund right away. If they aren’t sure how to use the product, provide them with the support they need. Take your time to make sure they always get excellent customer service.

5. Be transparent and communicative
No one wants to support a business that says one thing and then does another. When a business is transparent and communicative with its customers, it helps to build loyalty because your customers can trust you. Transparency also helps to foster customer retention because your customers will feel like they’re actually involved in the business processes.

6. Create personalized experiences
There’s no better feeling than receiving something that was made just for you. Personalized gifts make you feel special and cared for, and the same goes for personalized experiences. If your customer comes to you for help, don’t just reply with a generic response that you give to everyone. Take the time to understand their unique situation so that you can provide personal and genuine advice that is catered just to them.

7. Understand customer needs
A business’s ultimate goal is to help their customers. But in order to help your customers, you need to understand their needs. It’s imperative to actually listen to what your customers have to say so that you can create a product or service that works for them. Understanding your customer needs is a great way to increase customer retention because your customers will know that you have their best interests at heart.

8. Solicit customer feedback
Feedback—whether it’s good or bad—is crucial for a business, and one way you can build strong relationships with your customers is by asking them for their honest feedback. Sometimes hearing the truth hurts, but it’s necessary so that you can build your business to the best it can be.

Document Your Interactions: After each interaction, take a moment to jot down notes about the conversation. Note down the customer's main points, the emotions you identified, and how you reflected these emotions back to the customer.
Review & Reflect: At the end of the day or week, review your notes. Look for patterns in your ability to identify and reflect emotions. Are there certain emotions you're more attuned to? Are there others you find hard to identify or reflect?
Remember, the goal is to make the customer feel understood and validated. This exercise will help you improve your active listening skills and your ability to recognize and reflect emotions, ultimately enhancing your rapport with customers.

Section 6: Day 6

18. Day 6

19. Key Takeaways
Lecture Notes:
By honing the ability to listen to what's not being said, customer service professionals can gain a more comprehensive understanding of customer needs, deliver exceptional service, and leave customers satisfied.
Customer service goes beyond simply listening to what customers say; it's essential to also pay attention to what they don't say.
Customers often provide clues about their feelings and needs through non-verbal cues such as tone of voice, body language, facial expressions, and gestures.
For example, a customer may not explicitly express disappointment or frustration, but their flat tone, frowning, or crossed arms can indicate these emotions.
When communicating face-to-face, observing facial expressions and body language is easier, while over the phone, listening for cues in the customer's voice becomes crucial.
Similar to a detective following clues to solve a case, customer service professionals need to pay close attention to both verbal and non-verbal cues.
Reading between the lines and paying attention to the smallest details help provide the best possible service.
Probing questions may still be necessary to seek further clarification if something is not clear or if customers are hesitant to express their concerns openly.

20. Practice Exercise for Day 6
Objective: To improve your ability to understand what customers aren't saying, by focusing on non-verbal cues and subtleties in their communication.
Instructions:
Prepare for Customer Interactions: Begin your day with a reminder to yourself to be more observant during customer interactions. Your goal is to pick up on non-verbal cues and subtle hints in their communication.
Observe and Listen Actively: During each interaction, pay close attention to the customer's tone of voice, pauses, and the words they choose to use or avoid. If you're interacting face-to-face, observe their facial expressions, body language, and gestures as well.
Note Down Observations: After each interaction, jot down your observations about the customer's non-verbal cues and their unvoiced feelings or needs. Did you notice any signs of dissatisfaction, even if the customer didn't voice it? Were there any indications of unmet needs in their tone or choice of words?
Ask Probing Questions: If you sense that there's something a customer isn't saying, don't hesitate to ask probing questions. This could be as simple as, "Is there anything else you're concerned about?" or "Do you have any other needs that we haven't addressed yet?"
Reflect and Learn: At the end of the day or week, review your notes. Look for patterns and common cues that hint at unvoiced customer needs or emotions. Use these insights to improve your observation skills in future interactions.

Reflect on the Impact: At the end of the day or week, reflect on how these practices have impacted your relationships at work and with customers. Have you noticed any changes in customer feedback or satisfaction?
Celebrate Progress & Set New Goals: Celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Recognizing your own growth is crucial for maintaining motivation. Also, set new goals based on your self-assessments and reflections.

Customer Service Training: Dealing with Difficult Customers

The ECA Method (Empathy, Control, Advocacy) is a proven system to handle complicated situations with customers and turn them into ambassadors of our brand.  


The Empathy part is divided into 3 steps:
First: listen, assess, and begin to take control of the situation.
Second: let them know that you understand their situation.
Third: show them that you understand and reassure them.
The Control part is also divided into 3 steps:
First: redirect the situation: try to guide the client from a negative to a positive state of mind.
Second: Confirm what the client really wants.
Third: Fix the situation.
The Advocacy part is also divided into 3 steps:
First: End the interaction in an efficient, polite, and friendly manner.
Second: Choose your last words well to help turn your customer into a brand ambassador.
Third: Finally, and if possible, follow up.

Understand and empathize with difficult customers:
Understanding why some customers behave in abusive or difficult ways is essential before dealing with them. This allows us to be more empathetic.
We all go through difficult times in our lives. We don't know what is going on in the customer's life. So we should not take their behavior personally.
The main goal is to help people to change their moods and spread happiness to others.
We must listen to them, understand them and try to show empathy to help us reach a satisfactory agreement for both parties.




Showing empathy is essential when dealing with an upset customer.

Pointing blame and telling them they should talk to another department can worsen the situation.

The proper way to acknowledge the situation and reassure them that you will help them is divided into 3 steps:

First: apologize for the situation.

Second, let them know you will do everything possible to help them resolve the situation.

Third: let them know that you are working to resolve the situation and tell them approximately how long they will have to wait for a solution.

Redirect the situation:
It is difficult to stay angry and rude in front of a person who treats you with a lot of kindness and respect and wants to help you. Therefore, it is essential that we use this idea to change the customer's frame of mind.
Empathy, kindness, and a willingness to help can redirect an angry situation.
Positive language is critical when dealing with difficult customers; it helps redirect the situation.
The words we choose can have a significant impact on how the customer reacts and will help redirect their frustration into something more productive.
Positive language not only spreads happiness but also has personal benefits, such as receiving positive feedback from customers and bosses, as well as earning good online reviews for the business itself.
Confirm what they want: 
It's essential to always confirm what customers want, even if it seems obvious.
It is especially important with difficult customers to avoid misunderstandings and prevent them from exploding. It can help avoid a situation where you are unhappy with the outcome.
When dealing with difficult customers, special care must be taken in how we confirm their wants and needs to prevent them from becoming angry or explosive.
Asking questions like "What can I do today to make you happy?" or confirming the customer's request by saying something like "I want to make sure we get this resolved and you are as happy as possible..." are good ways to make sure the customer gets what they need, and will ensure that all requests are understood correctly by both parties involved.
Fix the situation:
Solving difficult customer situations requires understanding, empathy, and offering options.
The best way to handle a situation where you cannot satisfy the customer's request is to offer alternatives they feel in control of.
It is essential not to make clients feel guilty or defensive; instead, show them sympathy for their plight and try your best to find an amicable solution that works for both parties.
A real-life example of this was when a store accepted a $450 camera back even though it was past its 14-day return deadline, and the customer bought $5,000 worth of photography equipment instead.
We must always keep an open mind to the possible solutions we can offer customers. More often than we think, we can find solutions that benefit the customer and our company.
